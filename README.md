## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1.Define Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).
-Through the usage of software components known as services, business applications are developed using the service-oriented architecture (SOA) technique of software development. In addition to being able to interact across platforms and languages, each service offers a particular business feature.
2.List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
•Loose coupling - It makes the implementation of services easier without affecting other services or applications.

•Standardized service contract - The SOAP protocol was first used to implement SOA.  A WSDL is necessary in order to use SOAP services. This model is made simpler and more user-friendly using REST. REST transmits data using a collection of resources and verbs using a request-response mechanism. 

•Abstraction - A service conceals from the user its underlying technology. The Enterprise can define technology inside the framework of a business process thanks to abstraction.  Dependencies are broken and agility is introduced by abstraction.  

•Reusability - Services are simpler to test and debug because of their tiny size.

•Composability - The modular services that the enterprise provides to its user base are its fundamental components. It's also been said that company will become more modular in the future.  

•Manage complexity - Service specifications help to isolate the complexities and make integration easier to handle.

3.Define Microservices.
-Software developed using the architectural and organizational framework of microservices is made up of discrete, autonomous services that interact with one another via clear application programming interfaces. The owners of these services are compact, independent teams.

4.List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.

•Independently deployable - Microservices promise to provide businesses with an antidote to the visceral discomfort associated with modest changes taking enormous amounts of time. This is maybe the single most essential property of microservices.

•Right tool for the job - A sizable relational database usually serves as the application's main source of support, and all applications share a common stack. Even while there is a clear, better tool for the job for some aspects, this strategy has numerous obvious limitations, the most major of which is that every component of an application must share a common stack, data model, and database.

•Precise scaling - Microservices enable the deployment and scaling of individual services on an individual basis. When implemented properly, microservices allow for exact scaling of only the components that require it rather than the entire program, as is the case with monolithic apps which results in a clear advantage over monolithic applications in terms of infrastructure requirements.
5.List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices

•Microservices design is application-specific, while Service-Oriented design (SOA) was an enterprise-wide attempt to standardize how all services talk to and integrate with each other.

•The scope of the two techniques is the primary difference between them. In short, the microservices architecture has an application scope, whereas the service-oriented architecture (SOA) has an enterprise scope.

•The concept of microservices architecture is application-scoped. It makes it possible to divide out an application's internals into manageable chunks that can be scaled, modified, and adjusted on their own. It does not specify how apps communicate with one another; for that, we must refer to the enterprise scope of the SOA-provided service interfaces.

•Ignoring the differences makes many of the fundamental ideas of each method irreconcilable. It's clear that the two might work well together rather than against one another provided the scope disparities are acknowledged.
